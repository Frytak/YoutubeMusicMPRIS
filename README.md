# YouTube Music MPRIS
Personal project implementing [MPRIS](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/MPRIS) for a pinned YouTube Music tab in Firefox. This project is personalized for my specific use case, I don't plan on generalizing it to expose an [MPRIS](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/MPRIS) interface for each tab (at least not in the near future), it was quickly thrown together, using abandoned packages. A better implementation could be made with [native messaging](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging) and a server implemented in something more efficient than Node.
